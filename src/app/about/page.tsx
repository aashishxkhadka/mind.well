                  <p>
                    MindWell was founded in 2023 by Dr. Aashish Khadka, a psychiatrist who recognized the growing need
                    for accessible mental health resources. After years of working in traditional clinical settings, Dr.
                    Khadka saw how many people struggled to access quality mental healthcare due to cost, stigma, and
                    limited availability of services.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a vision to break down these barriers, he assembled a team of mental health professionals and
                    technology experts to create MindWell—a comprehensive digital platform that provides evidence-based
                    tools and resources for mental health support.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Today, MindWell serves thousands of users worldwide, offering a range of features from mood tracking
                    and self-assessment to AI-powered support and telepsychiatry services. Our team continues to grow,
                    but our mission remains the same: to make mental healthcare accessible to everyone who needs it.
